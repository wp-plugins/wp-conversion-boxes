== Description ==

= WP Conversion Boxes - Same Traffic. More Conversions. =

Easily boost your conversion rates using our advanced attention grabbing box settings to grab user attention for more conversions and use the inbuilt conversion tracking system to track every important stats of your email optin and call to action boxes.

And that's not all, the plugin comes with loads of other features that help you boost your conversion rates!

= How is WP Conversion Boxes Different From Other Similar Plugins? =

There are a lot features that set WP Conversion Boxes apart from competition:

*   **Create multiple conversion boxes** - This feature is specially very important if you are serious about conversion rate on your blog from your CTAs or email subscription boxes.

    Most people use just one version of CTA or email subscription box under their posts/pages (or elsewhere). But this is what affects the conversion rate the most as the copy written in the box not always match the content written in the respective posts/pages.

    But with WP Conversion Boxes you can create as may variation of the boxes you want, specific to content of the posts/page where you put it. You can also have different boxes for different categories for targeting people with specific interests with specific box copies.

*   **Track Your Conversions** - Know how many people visited the page containing your conversion box, the number of people who actually scrolled the page down and saw the box! and the number of people who actually clicked on your call to action or filled in their email address.

    Know specifically the boxes and posts/pages that are bringing you the most conversions and then use that data to optimise your call to action copy or use the same copy across your site or whatever you want to do with that useful data.

*   **2-Step Optin Link (New)** - Mostly available with Paid/Premium plugins, you can now create 2-Step Optin Links with WP Conversion Boxes for FREE!

    Create a 2-Step Optin Link conversion box as usual and paste the shortcode in your content or landing page. The shortcode will display a link with your desired call-to-action. When a user clicks this link, it'll open the email optin box you created, in a lightbox popup!

    Cool, isn't it? We're not shoving an email optin box directly in the visitor's face, but hiding it behind a beautiful looking link. Research have shown that 2-step optin links can drastically boost your conversion by upto 600%!

*   **High Impact Box Settings** - Grab the visitor’s attention with flashing conversion box. WP Conversion Boxes comes with an option to flash the box when user scrolls down and reaches the box. This flashing of the box grabs the visitor’s attention, increasing the chances of conversion.

    The plugin also comes with an option to make the conversion box sticky. This causes the box to stick to the top of the window when the visitor scrolls past the box, again helping you to grab the attention of the visitors.

*   **Video Enabled Conversion Boxes** - Create call to action and email subscription boxes with embedded video for more impact. Having a short video in your conversion boxes can help you boost your conversions many folds.

*   **Advanced Template System** - If you already have a designed conversion box on your blog, you don’t have to change it’s design to use WP Conversion Boxes! With our advanced templating system, you can easily create custom templates for WP Conversion Boxes. So now, you get to keep your initial design but with a more advance managing and conversion tracking system.

    You may design the template on your own or you may get the template made for WP Conversion Boxes for just $49 by contacting us.

    The plugin also includes advanced real-time template customiser which can be used to edit almost every aspect of your template without the need to ever touch the code!

= Conversion Booster Strategies and Tips For Your Email Optin/Call-to-Action Boxes =

Following are some of our most popular strategies and tips on boosting conversion rates on your blog using WP Conversion Boxes:

* [Conversion Booster Strategy #1 – Category Wise Box Placement](http://wpconversionboxes.com/conversion-booster-strategy-1-category-wise-box-placement/) - Use different lists for gathering leads from boxes made for different categories. This will help you track which category leads bring more sales so that you can start focusing on creating more content for that particular category.

* [Conversion Booster Strategy #2 – Popular Post Box Placement](http://wpconversionboxes.com/conversion-booster-strategy-2-popular-post-box-placement/) - I talked above about having different boxes for different categories. To further pump this up you can dig down deeper and create different boxes specific to individual best performing posts or most trafficked posts.

	With this you’ll have winner combinations of a posts and a conversion boxes too! Can you imagine how far you can take this and really boost the conversion rate making the most out of each piece of content on your site?

	Now move to the other posts and pages and repeat the process until you have with you the best possible optimised combinations of all the posts/pages and conversion boxes on your site. I call this **Extreme Conversion Optimization!**

* On the plugin’s main page you’ll also see an option for Detailed Stats under each box. Clicking it will take you to a page showing top 10 most performing pages/posts for that particular conversion box. Each showing all the stats for the listed posts/pages. Use this to see which pages are bringing you the best results.

* I’ve included A/B Testing feature in the [Pro](http://wpconversionboxes.com/) version of this plugin. So if you are a more advanced user, using the [WP Conversion Boxes Pro](http://wpconversionboxes.com/) version will be more will help you micro test and find better versions of box copies.

See, you will usually find all these features being sold in premium plugins. But with WP Conversion Boxes you get all of this for FREE!
